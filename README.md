# Page Form With Bootstrap
<p align="center">             
<img width="350" height="200" src="/images/demo.gif" />
</p>  
  
  # How did the idea come about?
  
The page was developed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

This project was a challenge from module 12 of the EBAC course to put into practice what I learned in Bootstrap classes.

**Bootstrap:**

- Typography
- Collapse
- Form
- Attributes
- Manipulation of elements
